The models and templates of this app can be found in the `home` folder.

## A forum
The forum is powered by [machina](https://github.com/ellmetha/django-machina) and uses [mistune](https://github.com/lepture/mistune) for markdown formating.

Custom template forum base template in  [openstudyroom/templates/boardbase.html](/openstudyroom/templates/board_base.html).

## A league app
Allow hosting go leagues where games are played on the KGS or OGS go server. A cron job can get games automatically from those servers.

Note that the auth model `league.models.User ` is in here.

The scraper() function inside `league.views` is run by cron every 5 mins.

It's all under the [league](/league) folder.

## A tournament app
Allow hosting go tournaments. Games must be uploaded manually by admins.

## A calendar and game planning tools
